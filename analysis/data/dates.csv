From Passions Just Like Mine:


Postponed and never rescheduled.

Morrissey may have been referring to this concert when he told the Pittsbugh Post-Gazette in 2013: ""I arrived for the soundcheck and I was told that the night had to be 'pulled' because the stage wasn't safe. There were a lot of people queuing in the rain, and backstage was abysmal -- I don't think there was even a toilet. When you're faced with such situations you feel so much anger with local promoters because they charge such high ticket prices yet they have no concern for either the comfort of the artist or the safety of the audience ... they think the night will just roll along on enthusiasm, which is wrong."""

Originally it was only going to be a few days before he resume his tour... but unfortunately the remainder of the 2012 dates were all postponed until 2013. Those 2013 announced were also cancelled due to ""a series of medical mishaps"", but you can read all about that in the 2013 entries."

282,16 Dec 2017,"CBS This Morning - Saturday Sessions (Although there is a 25% chance that Morrissey will cancel his Saturday Sessions, I don't think he will. The show is pre-recorded and only requires one or two songs. Based on Anthony Mason's Morrissey confirmation and Morrissey's recent feisty Der Spiegel comment, it sounded like he's feeling much better.  But who knows.  We'll find out this Saturday. Update 12/14/2017: It's possible that Morrissey will not appear live at all, but that CBS will use pre-recorded live concert footage. Update 12/17/2017: Confirmed, Morrissey did not show up. Instead, CBS used footage from Morrissey's appearance at The Anthem in Washington DC from Nov 30, before he fell ill.)"

From Passions Just Like Mine:


Postponed and never rescheduled.

Morrissey may have been referring to this concert when he told the Pittsbugh Post-Gazette in 2013: ""I arrived for the soundcheck and I was told that the night had to be 'pulled' because the stage wasn't safe. There were a lot of people queuing in the rain, and backstage was abysmal -- I don't think there was even a toilet. When you're faced with such situations you feel so much anger with local promoters because they charge such high ticket prices yet they have no concern for either the comfort of the artist or the safety of the audience ... they think the night will just roll along on enthusiasm, which is wrong."""

Those 2013 announced were also cancelled due to ""a series of medical mishaps"", but you can read all about that in the 2013 entries."

581,16 Dec 2017,"CBS This Morning - Saturday Sessions (Although there is a 25% chance that Morrissey will cancel his Saturday Sessions, I don't think he will. The show is pre-recorded and only requires one or two songs. Based on Anthony Mason's Morrissey confirmation and Morrissey's recent feisty Der Spiegel comment, it sounded like he's feeling much better.  But who knows.  We'll find out this Saturday. Update 12/14/2017: It's possible that Morrissey will not appear live at all, but that CBS will use pre-recorded live concert footage. Update 12/17/2017: Confirmed, Morrissey did not show up. Instead, CBS used footage from Morrissey's appearance at The Anthem in Washington DC from Nov 30, before he fell ill.)"
